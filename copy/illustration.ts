    description:
      'My earliest memory drawing was getting a sketchbook, some colored pencils, and some stamps for Easter when I was probably 6 or 7. I drew throughout high school and into college. Graphic design was part of the College of Fine Arts so I took drawing and painting classes, and spent a year studying print making on my way to an eventual degree in graphic design. I’ve drawn, or illustrated, as far back as I can remember. Since college that’s mostly been digitally. Whether as a creative outlet or to bring life or delight to product design, the styles vary but it’s still a part of my creative process. '
