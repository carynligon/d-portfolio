    description: 'Accessibility is an important part of the training new designers receive as part of IBM’s new hire design camp program. Designers are given materials they can utilize and take part in accessibility hackathon to build empathy, skills, and an understanding of the role accessibility plays in the design process. Even with the emphasis on accessibility initially, those experiences are often forgotten or not applied. The goal of this project was to empower not only designers, but developers and product managers across IBM to deliver inclusive, accessible products.',

      'Within IBM product teams, accessibility is not always a part of the process from the beginning. When it is considered, the responsibility falls on individual members or parts of the team instead of being integral to the full product process. Engineering teams will work to comply with standards in order to deliver code on time or designers may focus on a small portion of accessibility, but it’s not an regular practice for teams. This leads to teams having an incomplete understanding of the role they play in delivering accessible products, how to teach the rest of their team accessible, and a buildup of accessibility debt.',

      'IBM Design had an existing series of physical handbooks on various topics for designers to reference during different parts of the design process. Teams liked having the ability to highlight, take notes, and pass it around their teams. With existing templates and a relatively quick turnaround time, the physical handbook was our MVP. We worked with subject matter experts around IBM to create content and resources for designers, developers, and product managers, while designing the layouts and supporting visuals in parallel.',
      'While a physical handbook was our MVP and initial deliverable, we also designed a website and downloadable PDF as well. This allowed for easier access to links, a way to update and add content, and a way to quickly share resources with our global product teams. Both version are still available for teams across IBM and have helped evolve the IBM Accessibility site into what it is today.',

      'There were process improvements for teams that were able to utilize the Accessibility Handbook. It made it easier for teams to address issues early in the process instead of having to make updates late in release cycles or based on existing debt. More time was also being built into the process from a product management standpoint. This is largely due to a shift in how teams viewed accessibility. Instead of just seeing it as a mandattory step in the process, teams were able to recognize the financial value of design accessible products and the social value of considering diversity, equity, and inclusion in how we build teams and how we build products.',
