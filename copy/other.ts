So when we were looking for a project to work on together, it seemed like a great place to start. With her looking for more experience with React Native and me wanting to explore new tools and more mobile design, we decided to work on a coffee app that we called Brew. The goal was to create a place for beginners to learn more about coffee and to perfect different brew methods while also serving as a place for more experienced brewers to share their knowledge. It’s an ongoing project, and one we pick up here and there when we’re looking for a side project.'
