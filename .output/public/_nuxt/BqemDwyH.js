When it is considered, the responsibility falls on individual members or parts of the team instead of being integral to the full product process. Engineering teams will work to comply with standards in order to deliver code on time or designers may focus on a small portion of accessibility, but it’s not an regular practice for teams. This leads to teams having an incomplete understanding of the role they play in delivering accessible products, how to teach the rest of their team accessible, and a buildup of accessibility debt."]},stats:{quote:"In its first year, the IBM Accessibility Handbook had more than 50k views and over 10k printed copies distributed.",noQuotes:!0,author:"According to John Maeda’s 2017 Design in Tech Report"},process:{title:"Our process",subtitle:"Provide new principles and practices for everyone on the team.",paragraphs:["IBM Design had an existing series of physical handbooks on various topics for designers to reference during different parts of the design process. Teams liked having the ability to highlight, take notes, and pass it around their teams. With existing templates and a relatively quick turnaround time, the physical handbook was our MVP. We worked with subject matter experts around IBM to create content and resources for designers, developers, and product managers, while designing the layouts and supporting visuals in parallel.","While a physical handbook was our MVP and initial deliverable, we also designed a website and downloadable PDF as well. This allowed for easier access to links, a way to update and add content, and a way to quickly share resources with our global product teams. Both version are still available for teams across IBM and have helped evolve the IBM Accessibility site into what it is today."]},designForEveryone:{subtitle:"Helping teams recognize the value of designing for everyone.",paragraphs:["There were process improvements for teams that were able to utilize the Accessibility Handbook. It made it easier for teams to address issues early in the process instead of having to make updates late in release cycles or based on existing debt. More time was also being built into the process from a product management standpoint. This is largely due to a shift in how teams viewed accessibility. Instead of just seeing it as a mandattory step in the process, teams were able to recognize the financial value of design accessible products and the social value of considering diversity, equity, and inclusion in how we build teams and how we build products."]},outcomes:{title:"Outcomes",paragraphs:["In 2016, sixty copies were distributed by the head of IBM Design on Capitol Hill at a Congressional hearing on the topic of accessibility.
