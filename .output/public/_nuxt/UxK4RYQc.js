With more teams and types of content to include and a growing need to improve consistency and alignment across teams, our old system was having trouble scaling.

For the Security team the solution is a local design system built off of Carbon and the IDL which we call our Experience Guide. It started as a combination of brand guidelines, marketing templates, and a set of reusable components. It only served a small part of our larger Design organization. As our team grew and our needs evolved, we needed a way to include more guidance for more teams as well as a way avoid duplication and maintain consistency between our Experience Guide and the IBM Design Language and Carbon.

We knew there was content that didn’t fit within our current system and that it didn’t align with updates to the IBM Design Language, but the larger problem was inclusion. We had designers and teams throughout our organization whose needs weren’t being met by our current system.","So to start, we needed to understand how teams were currently using our Experience Guide and why it hadn’t been adopted by other teams. From interviewing team we gained a few key insights. For our research team, there was no place to document and contribute research and no way for designers to find and consume that research. For our brand design team, they had their own design guidelines and didn’t want another place to have to go. Lastly, we learned that new designers and teams without design support didn’t know about the experience guide and if they did they didn’t know how to start using it."]},buildingHome:{subtitle:"Applying systems thinking to building a home for our design system.",paragraphs:["With an understanding of the pain points and user needs, and a goal of a more inclusive home for our design resources and documention, I began exploring and iterating on our new Experience Guide.","Our original Experience Guide was unique to our team. The visual design and overall experience aligned with our brand and our product but there was no consistency across IBM. With the emphasis on aligning products around the new IBM Design Language and Carbon Design System, my approach was to design a seamless experience for those resources and our Experience Guide while leaving room to express IBM Security’s new brand. This would allow us to deliver and scale quickly by utilizing existing design patterns and components, and would create a better experience for users needing to the IDL, Carbon, and our local system.","From iterating and exploring, I user tested designs with different teams, aligned with stakeholders, and then continued to iterate until I had a system that addressed the needs and pain points we identified earlier."]},newSkills:{subtitle:"Using new skills to help empower teammates to focus on their strengths.",paragraphs:["The scope and size of this project grew significantly from the time we started, but the size of the team stayed the same: one designer and one front-end developer. I had minimal coding experience and none from a professional standpoint, but when the implementation work started to surpass the design needs, I knew there was more I could do to help Randy, the front-end developer on the team.","Making style changes, adding new content, and pushing code changes on my own gave me more experience and an opportunity to grow my skills but more importantly gave Randy the opportunity to focus on larger, more complicated development tasks.

The first was improved collaboration within and across teams. Within teams, a more seamless experience between documentation and a central place for onboarding materials allowed new designs to ramp up quickly. Across teams and across our business, the Experience Guide brought more teams to the table. We began collaborating more closely with our Brand, Marketing, and even Strategy teams which allowed us to align our work and our goals, and work as a single, unified Design team.","Across IBM, the outcome was alignment around how to approach local design systems. Influenced by the work done by our team, Experience Guide became the way for teams to delivery their systems. Built off the IBM Design Language and Carbon Design System, and eventually a shared Gatsby theme, it created a scalable way for teams to deliver while also helping teams across IBM improve consistency across products."]},next:{title:"What’s next",paragraphs:["Our team is currently working on a variety of projects including account creations, multi-account management, and empowering developers to build applications, add-ons, or integrations on our platform.
